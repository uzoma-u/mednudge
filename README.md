Mednudge is a **medication tracking web application** that helps users manage their medication schedules with timely reminders, log their doses, and maintain adherence over time. Designed for both **patients and doctors**, Mednudge also offers a secure, role-based system to control access, with future support for fine-grained Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Users can also **share their medication records with doctors**, enabling better communication and support. A secure chat feature is planned for future releases.
